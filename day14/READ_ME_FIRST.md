To run the code you must execute the command
```bash
go run .
```
This code will plot the result of the falling sand simulation.
Since the simulation is very big, you should zoom out if you want to see the final result.
If you don't want to print anything, just comment the following lines in the file `day14.go`:
- 252
- 263 
- 286
